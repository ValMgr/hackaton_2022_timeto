# Time to [play]

Time to is a Responsability society of enterprise (RSE) awareness-raising workshop based on a collaborative game followed by debates that can be led by a speaker from outside the company. The objective is to raise the participants' collective awareness of the environmental, social, economic and ethical issues at stake in their activities.
Time to is halfway between a management game and a quiz that lasts about an hour depending on the number of participants. At the beginning of the game, the team will have a budget which they will have to manage and conduct according to the decisions taken during the game.
